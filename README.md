# FileManager
A program that helps us automate the management of files on our computer

In this way, every time we download files that go to our downloads folder, we will send files from downloads to the folder we choose with a single click.

       TO DO:
          - Create folders where we want to send the files
          - Check if the folders were created correctly
          - Move the files to the right folders
